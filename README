LinkList Generics Exercise

You will find your code template in the src/MyLinkedList.java file. Currently, this template functions as a linked list that only stores Integer objects.
The driver of this linked list implementation can be found in src/Main.java DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE!!!
Your task is to change the src/MyLinkedList.java linked list implementation to accept objects of any type, not just Integer objects.
When you are finished, run the driver and show the instructors your output. Note: the main driver expects both MyIntLinkedList.java and MyLinkedList.java to 
be present in the src directory. DO NOT EDIT MyIntLinkedList.java!!!
